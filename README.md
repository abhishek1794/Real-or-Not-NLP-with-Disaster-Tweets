# Real-or-Not-NLP-with-Disaster-Tweets
It was a NLP classification problem to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. The dataset included more than 10k tweets which were cleaned and pre-processed using RegEx and NLTK library. The dataset was subjected to data Visualization. The model was developed using SVM and Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.
We were able to use Twitter as a communication channel in times of emergency. By monitoring the tweets in real-time, the concerned agencies can identify disasters and take suitable measures to mitigate the loss of life and property.
